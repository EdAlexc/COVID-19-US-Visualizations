Intro-- why is this interesting from a data perspective?

While the challenge involves forecasting confirmed cases and fatalities between April 1 and April 30 by region, the primary goal isn't only to produce accurate forecasts. Itâ€™s also to identify factors that appear to impact the transmission rate of COVID-19.
